To install kakadu source:

add the follow to ./managed/make/Makefile-Linux-x86-64-gcc

INCLUDES += -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/include       # or wherever the Java
INCLUDES += -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/include/linux # includes are on your system

To add TIFF capability, add:

DEFINES += -DKDU_INCLUDE_TIFF

in ./apps/make/Makefile-Linux-x86-64-gcc   

(There's no libtiff5-dev and libtiff5 package in Ubuntu 12.0)

Then:

cd ./make
sudo make -f Makefile-Linux-x86-64-gcc

Make sure there is only one .so library in src/loris/lib/Linux/x86_64. If you're changing version of kakadu you'll need to delete the 7.2 version library there.

Copy the test images over

If you're installing anything other than version 7.2, you'll get the following error when installing loris:

error: can't copy 'lib/Linux/x86_64/libkdu_v72R.so': doesn't exist or not a regular file

Apart from the path issues in webapp.py, setup.py, it would seem the application is also hardcoded to version 7.2 of kakadu
